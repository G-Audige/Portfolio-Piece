# Portfolio and Google API search

This will be a simple project showcasing my portfolio and a search through the Google Books API.

# Technologies

This project uses useState and useContext to manage variables between and withing components and pages. It also uses useEffect to determine when to fetch data.

# Unsolved Problems

As of the point, when shifting through pages, the search pulls data starting at an index number for each request. This can cause the results to be incosistent. The search is also inconsistent at changing requests, often just going to the first index of the current request and reuiring a second click to make the correct search.
